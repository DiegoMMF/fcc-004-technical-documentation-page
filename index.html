        useState
      </header><!-- User Story #5 -->
      <code>const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);</code><!-- User Story #6 -->
      <p>Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.</p>
      <p>During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument
        (initialState).</p>
      <p>The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the
        component.</p>
      <code>setState(newState);</code>
      <p>During subsequent re-renders, the first value returned by useState will always be the most recent state after
        applying updates.</p>
      <p>If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will
        receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Here’s an example of a counter component that uses both
        forms of setState:</p>
      <code>function Counter({initialCount}) {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
        return (
          < >
            Count: {count}
            < button onClick={
              () => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset< /button>
            < button onClick={
              () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-< /button>
            < button onClick={
              () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+< /button>
          < />
        );
      }</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="useEffect">
      <header>
        useEffect
      </header>
      <code>useEffect(didUpdate);</code>
      <p>Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.</p>
      <p>Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a
        function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and
        inconsistencies in the UI.</p>
      <p>Instead, use useEffect. The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen.
        Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world.</p>
      <p>By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values
        have changed.</p>
      <p>Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, the function passed to useEffect fires after layout and paint,
        during a deferred event. This makes it suitable for the many common side effects, like setting up subscriptions
        and event handlers, because most types of work shouldn’t block the browser from updating the screen.</p>
      <p>However, not all effects can be deferred. For example, a DOM mutation that is visible to the user must fire
        synchronously before the next paint so that the user does not perceive a visual inconsistency. (The distinction
        is conceptually similar to passive versus active event listeners.) For these types of effects, React provides
        one additional Hook called useLayoutEffect. It has the same signature as useEffect, and only differs in when it
        is fired.</p>
      <p>Although useEffect is deferred until after the browser has painted, it’s guaranteed to fire before any new
        renders. React will always flush a previous render’s effects before starting a new update.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="useContext">
      <header>
        useContext
      </header>
      <code>const value = useContext(MyContext);</code>
      <p>Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value
        for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest < MyContext.Provider>
          above the calling component in the tree.</p>
      <p>When the nearest < MyContext.Provider> above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the
          latest context value passed to that MyContext provider. Even if an ancestor uses React.memo or
          shouldComponentUpdate, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using useContext.</p>
      <p>A component calling useContext will always re-render when the context value changes. If re-rendering the
        component is expensive, you can optimize it by using memoization.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="useReducer">
      <header>
        useReducer
      </header>
      <code>const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);</code>
      <p>An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current
        state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)</p>
      <p>useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple
        sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for
        components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.</p>
      <p>There are two different ways to initialize useReducer state. You may choose either one depending on the use
        case. The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument:</p>
      <p>You can also create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an init function as the third argument.
        The initial state will be set to init(initialArg).</p>
      <p>It lets you extract the logic for calculating the initial state outside the reducer. This is also handy for
        resetting the state later in response to an action:</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="useCallback">
      <header>
        useCallback

      <code>const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
        () => {
          doSomething(a, b);
        },
        [a, b],
      );</code>
      <p>Returns a memoized callback.</p>
      <p>Pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies. useCallback will return a memoized version of the
        callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to
        optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g.
        shouldComponentUpdate).</p>
